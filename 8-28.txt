Color Grading 101: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAh83khT1no

-Color Correction: Harmonizes Image. Correct White Balance, Equalize the Exposure, Reduce the Highlights, increase the Midtones, Apply Noise Reduction
-Color Grading: Curves, Masks, Color Wheels, and other precise tools to get the look we want.
-RAW Recordings have the most information, but take a lot of space.
-LOG uses an optimized gamma curve to save as much info as possible to record highlights and shadows. A good middle ground. Usually use a Log Version to REC.709
-ACES is a Dynamic Color Space that lets you work with the full color space without needing to convert. Good for distributing on multiple platforms.
-LUTs cannot do corrections or additions, just handle colors.
-Try to keep LUTs between 25 - 50% used in the end result.
-Waveform: Overexposed and Underexposed areas are pure white and pure black.
-RGB Parade: Check that our RGB is balanced. Control White Balance.
-Vector Scope: A good balanced image is centered in the middle of the Vector Scope. Good for checking Scopes.
-RGB curve allows for the correction of contrast.
-Hue vs Saturation: Increase the saturation based on a Hue.
-Hue vs Luma: Modify luminance based on Hue.
-Luma vs Sat: Modify saturation based on Luminance. Highlights and shadows.
-Hue vs Hue: Modify Hue by Hue

	-Can place Details and Cast on the same screen.
-Title is integrated in the shot in a manner that is unobtrusive and follows the rules of shot composition.
-When the title is tracked into the shot. Such as graffiti.
-Big Text. Interruption and confrontation.
-Minimalism can influence tone. The Title needs to align with the content.
-Sound Design: If you want impact, pair the title with a hard sound. If you want subtle, pair it with a sound from the scene. Can pair it with the start of a music track and a cut.

Best Code Architecture For Indie Games: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WqYQ1OwxJ4
-Reusable Modules/Systems.
-Connect Components with no code in engine: Exposed Fields, Events, etc.
-Connect Components with dedicated Glue Code: Game Managers, System Connectors.
-Write Systems with the intent to use them in future projects.
-Don't have one monolith game manager.
-Try to keep code and data separate. Keep things in a spreadsheet, Scriptable Objects, etc.
-If it is game designed together, store it together. Data should be easy to work with, update, expand, mod.
-Try to control execution order when possible.
-Separate the gameplay and art
