Gain Staging: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq5lDHCKt84
------------
- Gain Staging: The pre-mix process of changing the gain of all of your recordings so that they sit around the same level.
- It is not volume balancing. Gain and volume are not the same.
- The volume of a track is how loud a track is after processing. The gain is how loud a track is before it's been processed.
- Gain is your input level, volume is your output level.
- Changing your volume doesn't mean changing your gain.
- How do you change gain? Add a plugin at the top of a channel / Or use the DAWs gain system.
- What should you change the gain to? 0dBVU. Use a VU Meter Plugin. Stage one track of a time. Loop the loudest part and make sure it sits at around 0. If it's dynamic, use the peaks.
- Sometimes you cannot get an item into the sweet spot due to digital clipping. Get it as close as possible.
- The more plugins a track will use, the better it will sound if you gain stage a recording. After practice, you should try to knock it out in less than 10 minutes.


Low End: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pGtnRIyusA
-------
- Shelf EQ to boost everything BUT the low end to make it cut through the mix better. Fletcher-Munson Curve


EQ Advice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrUpFF7nlOg
----------
- Balance Chart
- Seesaw Effect: Sometimes if you hear a problem on one end of the spectrum, the actual solution may be on the opposite side.


Gain Automation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aun6XN63Jvo
---------------
- When you automate the gain level of an audio file so that it averages the same level throughout the song.
- Automate areas of lower gain to match higher
- Peak doesn't matter. Average level should try to match.
- Volume automation AFTER gain automation can fix a problem with it sounding worse. Gain automation creates a consistent tone, volume automation helps with dynamics.
- Example: Boost gain on an instrument then lower volume back down.


How Fast Are Transients: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg4_vl65RxM
-----------------------
Attack Times on Compressors: Can be used to miss the initial transient. Timing is based on slope.


Ultimate Recording Checklist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjalL7csm5M
----------------------------
- Do A Take. Do I like it, yes or no?
- No, redo. Yes, keep.
- Listen to it bit by bit. If there are parts you don't like, punch them in (record over them).


Which Mixing Plugins to Upgrade First: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7UEwA-U73I
-------------------------------------
- Saturation Plugins: Fabfilter Saturn
- Reverb Plugins: Liquidsonic - Seventh Heaven, Valhalla Vintage
- Amp Simulator: Positive Grid - Bias Amp
- TDR Kotelnikov Compressor
- Loudmax Limiter


Your Vocals Are Too Loud: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWskyKzGvpc
------------------------
- Step 1: Create Brightness - Sounds that are brighter sound closer to the ear. Shelf on High End.
- Step 2: Create Consistency - Compression. Fast Attack, Slow Release, High Threshold.
   - Serial Compression: One compressor after the other with a lower threshold to smooth it down.
- Step 3: Get Rid of Masking
   - Masking: The perception of one sound is affected by the presence of another. Happens if they have a similar frequency.
   - Mute Button Method: 
      - Mute your instruments one at a time.
      - Listen to the vocal, not the instruments.
      - Ask yourself: Is the vocal suddenly louder or more present?
      - If not, then there's no masking between those two tracks.
      - If so, then masking is occurring.
      - Cut with EQ
- Step 4: Volume Balancing
   - Set your vocal level, set it down a few DB. Forces you to create perceived loudness.


How to Compress Vocals: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og8tYrFWazE
----------------------
1. Prep the Tracks before compression
	- Clip gain automation early on.
2. Remove Unwanted Frequencies
3. Tame the Peaks (First Compressor)
4. Add Further Consistency (Second Compressor). The use Make-up Gain
5. Add Excitement (Third Compressor). Slow attack time
6. Add Character. This is done through compressor types.
   - Examples: FET for peak, OPTO for consistency, FET for excitement.


Simple Mixing Workflow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrF2dra1S0
----------------------
1. Session Prep
	- Organize Tracks, Group similar tracks together, Color-coding, Labeling song sections, Gain Staging, Selecting Reference Tracks, Setting Buffer Size to it's highest limit.
2. Initial Balance
	- Faders and Panning. Get the best mix you can with just those.
3. Mix Bus
	- Add effects to here first.
4. Process Top down
	- Process Parent busses first, then process each individual channel as needed.
	- How is the tone? -> How are the dynamics? -> Does it need space?
5. Listen throughs
	- Listen through everything, beginning to end. Take notes on what needs to be fixed. Make Revisions. 3-5 Rounds.
6. Evaluate Translation
	- Make sure it sounds well on any system.
	- Use a Frequency Analyzer to check how closer yours is to the reference.
	- Add EQ at the end of Mix Bus Chain to nudge it as close as you can.
	- Choose any 3 Speaker Systems and play your mix in a playlist next to the reference track. Note any red flags. Phone, Bluetooth Speaker, Earbuds, etc.

Vocal Chain Order: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpaAijC4By0
-----------------
- Subtractive EQ -> Address Dynamics (Compression) -> Boost Please Frequencies (Additive EQ) -> Space and Depth (Reverb and Delay)

- Advanced: Tame Sibilance (Add after Additive before Wet Effects) -> Volume Automate (Use Gain Plugin to Automate instead of volume fader) -> Add Character (Compressor Types and Saturation)
	- Add Saturation first in the chain

Getting Weird with Parallel Compression: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRkMvuNZ8_E
---------------------------------------
1. Add Saturation to a parallel compressed track. Antares
2. Use Modulation and Automate it during specific parts
3. Use Pitch Shift. Antares Avox Mutator


Are Your Ears Broken: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VRsYNX5RdM
---------------------
1. Train your ears a little bit everyday.
2. Frequency is key.
3. Keep it quick and consistent.
4. Drills -> Analysis. (10 - 30 minutes)
	Drills: Soundgym.co / Other ear training websites
	Analysis: Remove Distractions. Pick a reference. Takes notes on what you hear. 
		Categories: Song: Pick
			    Tone: What's bright? What is dark? Overall? Are vocals crisp and up-front?
			    Balance: Volume Balance and Panning. What is up-front? Back? Where are things panned?
		            Dynamics: How punchy is it? How compressed?
			    Space: What kind of reverbs> Where is delay? Wet or dry mix? How is space used? What is the sense of depth?
			    Notes: Anything Else.

--------------------------------
1. Do Whatever you want to your Aux channels. EQ/Compress, etc.
2. Don't solve problems that don't exist.
3. Mixing is Dynamic. Have to go back through the mix. Volume Automation, etc.
4. 15 Dave Pensado Mix Tips
5. Use References
6. Take lots of breaks
7. Use Automation
8. Eqing the AUX
9. Get it right at the source.
10. Create Front and Back Depth
11. Check in Mono
12. Be intentional.
13. Parallel Processing
14. Creative vs Intellectual. Keep it balanced. Follow instincts. Start with Intellectual foundation, then forget it and focus on Creative.


Compression, Limiting, and Clipping: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pKbIRxhxIw
------------------------------------
1. Compression: Like Limiters by more options.
2. Limiter: Sound can't get any louder than the threshold.
3. Clipper: Chops the tops off of the peaks.
