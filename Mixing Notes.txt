Gain Staging: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq5lDHCKt84
------------
- Gain Staging: The pre-mix process of changing the gain of all of your recordings so that they sit around the same level.
- It is not volume balancing. Gain and volume are not the same.
- The volume of a track is how loud a track is after processing. The gain is how loud a track is before it's been processed.
- Gain is your input level, volume is your output level.
- Changing your volume doesn't mean changing your gain.
- How do you change gain? Add a plugin at the top of a channel / Or use the DAWs gain system.
- What should you change the gain to? 0dBVU. Use a VU Meter Plugin. Stage one track of a time. Loop the loudest part and make sure it sits at around 0. If it's dynamic, use the peaks.
- Sometimes you cannot get an item into the sweet spot due to digital clipping. Get it as close as possible.
- The more plugins a track will use, the better it will sound if you gain stage a recording. After practice, you should try to knock it out in less than 10 minutes.


Low End: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pGtnRIyusA
-------
- Shelf EQ to boost everything BUT the low end to make it cut through the mix better. Fletcher-Munson Curve


EQ Advice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrUpFF7nlOg
----------
- Balance Chart
- Seesaw Effect: Sometimes if you hear a problem on one end of the spectrum, the actual solution may be on the opposite side.


Gain Automation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aun6XN63Jvo
---------------
- When you automate the gain level of an audio file so that it averages the same level throughout the song.
- Automate areas of lower gain to match higher
- Peak doesn't matter. Average level should try to match.
- Volume automation AFTER gain automation can fix a problem with it sounding worse. Gain automation creates a consistent tone, volume automation helps with dynamics.
- Example: Boost gain on an instrument then lower volume back down.


How Fast Are Transients: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg4_vl65RxM
-----------------------
Attack Times on Compressors: Can be used to miss the initial transient. Timing is based on slope.


Ultimate Recording Checklist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjalL7csm5M
----------------------------
- Do A Take. Do I like it, yes or no?
- No, redo. Yes, keep.
- Listen to it bit by bit. If there are parts you don't like, punch them in (record over them).


Which Mixing Plugins to Upgrade First: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7UEwA-U73I
-------------------------------------
- Saturation Plugins: Fabfilter Saturn
- Reverb Plugins: Liquidsonic - Seventh Heaven, Valhalla Vintage
- Amp Simulator: Positive Grid - Bias Amp
- TDR Kotelnikov Compressor
- Loudmax Limiter


Your Vocals Are Too Loud: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWskyKzGvpc
------------------------
- Step 1: Create Brightness - Sounds that are brighter sound closer to the ear. Shelf on High End.
- Step 2: Create Consistency - Compression. Fast Attack, Slow Release, High Threshold.
   - Serial Compression: One compressor after the other with a lower threshold to smooth it down.
- Step 3: Get Rid of Masking
   - Masking: The perception of one sound is affected by the presence of another. Happens if they have a similar frequency.
   - Mute Button Method: 
      - Mute your instruments one at a time.
      - Listen to the vocal, not the instruments.
      - Ask yourself: Is the vocal suddenly louder or more present?
      - If not, then there's no masking between those two tracks.
      - If so, then masking is occurring.
      - Cut with EQ
- Step 4: Volume Balancing
   - Set your vocal level, set it down a few DB. Forces you to create perceived loudness.


How to Compress Vocals: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og8tYrFWazE
----------------------
1. Prep the Tracks before compression
	- Clip gain automation early on.
2. Remove Unwanted Frequencies
3. Tame the Peaks (First Compressor)
4. Add Further Consistency (Second Compressor). The use Make-up Gain
5. Add Excitement (Third Compressor). Slow attack time
6. Add Character. This is done through compressor types.
   - Examples: FET for peak, OPTO for consistency, FET for excitement.


Simple Mixing Workflow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrF2dra1S0
----------------------
1. Session Prep
	- Organize Tracks, Group similar tracks together, Color-coding, Labeling song sections, Gain Staging, Selecting Reference Tracks, Setting Buffer Size to it's highest limit.
2. Initial Balance
	- Faders and Panning. Get the best mix you can with just those.
3. Mix Bus
	- Add effects to here first.
4. Process Top down
	- Process Parent busses first, then process each individual channel as needed.
	- How is the tone? -> How are the dynamics? -> Does it need space?
5. Listen throughs
	- Listen through everything, beginning to end. Take notes on what needs to be fixed. Make Revisions. 3-5 Rounds.
6. Evaluate Translation
	- Make sure it sounds well on any system.
	- Use a Frequency Analyzer to check how closer yours is to the reference.
	- Add EQ at the end of Mix Bus Chain to nudge it as close as you can.
	- Choose any 3 Speaker Systems and play your mix in a playlist next to the reference track. Note any red flags. Phone, Bluetooth Speaker, Earbuds, etc.

Vocal Chain Order: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpaAijC4By0
-----------------
- Subtractive EQ -> Address Dynamics (Compression) -> Boost Please Frequencies (Additive EQ) -> Space and Depth (Reverb and Delay)

- Advanced: Tame Sibilance (Add after Additive before Wet Effects) -> Volume Automate (Use Gain Plugin to Automate instead of volume fader) -> Add Character (Compressor Types and Saturation)
	- Add Saturation first in the chain

Getting Weird with Parallel Compression: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRkMvuNZ8_E
---------------------------------------
1. Add Saturation to a parallel compressed track. Antares
2. Use Modulation and Automate it during specific parts
3. Use Pitch Shift. Antares Avox Mutator


Are Your Ears Broken: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VRsYNX5RdM
---------------------
1. Train your ears a little bit everyday.
2. Frequency is key.
3. Keep it quick and consistent.
4. Drills -> Analysis. (10 - 30 minutes)
	Drills: Soundgym.co / Other ear training websites
	Analysis: Remove Distractions. Pick a reference. Takes notes on what you hear. 
		Categories: Song: Pick
			    Tone: What's bright? What is dark? Overall? Are vocals crisp and up-front?
			    Balance: Volume Balance and Panning. What is up-front? Back? Where are things panned?
		            Dynamics: How punchy is it? How compressed?
			    Space: What kind of reverbs> Where is delay? Wet or dry mix? How is space used? What is the sense of depth?
			    Notes: Anything Else.

Compression, Limiting, and Clipping: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pKbIRxhxIw
------------------------------------
1. Compression: Like Limiters by more options.
2. Limiter: Sound can't get any louder than the threshold.
3. Clipper: Chops the tops off of the peaks.

Do you Need a Mix Bus Compression? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5aHSV_aTWs
----------------------------------
1. Limiters and Clippers faster and easier.
2. Multi-Band Compression as a way to shape the tone. Use it when you like part of the sound, but don't like other parts of it.

Stop High Passing Everything: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bJrPtXYNtI

2. Retains some of the harmonics by limiting it.


1000 Hours of Vocal Mixing Tutorials in 30 minutes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBigaeYW0mE
--------------------------------------------------

Music: Pitch Correction -> EQ -> Compression -> De-Esser (Can also be chained) -> Reverb -> Delay
Compression: More makes it upfront at the cost of losing Energy. Less makes it further but it has more energy. Gain staging helps reduce this
Can Automate Reverb to come in on empty spaces
Delay before a reverb. High Pass, Pull it up. Low Pass, Pull it down. Gets it out of the way of the lead vocal.
Delays are a better alternative to Reverb in a busy mix. Unsync Delay from BPM IF you want to hear it better. May not be often.
Flanger: Add Width. Helps if you did not record doubles or triples.
Formant Shifter: Change sound of voice without touching voice.
Sample Vocals: Take a portion of lead vocal, put it on a new track, put it into a sampler. Slice. Sensitivity Down to the Transients. Can then play on the Piano.
LFO: Emulating Side chains or Rhythmic Stuttering
Creative Bussing
Reversing Vocals: Take First Part of Lead Vocal. Drag to new track. Turn on Reverb. Crank it Up. Bounce it in place. Extend the Tail. Reverse the Track. Creates a Vocal Swell.
Distortion: Heavier form of Saturation. Can add grittiness and Energy to a vocal.
Doubles and Triples: Record the same part multiple times. Pan them hard left and hard right. Add a bit of EQ (Usually High Shelf) and make them more tuned.
More Energy can be achieved through recording the other vocal parts and octave up or an octave down.
Mixing Vocals: Mix into a limiter. Mix in Mono (Music only) at really low volumes.
Don't Solo Vocals.
Send all your instruments into a submix then sidechain it with the vocals. Dips out some range.
Editing: Get rid of plosives through fading
Recording: Closer you are, the boomier it is. The further you are, the thinner it is.
Record to a drum beat, not a metronome.


13 Mixing Tips: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCbugYCROCo
--------------
1. Cannot make a 5/10 -> 10/10. At most, 8/10 -> 10/10.
2. Learn technical then creative.
3. You cannot derive an ought from an is. What you do with something is totally subjective.
	- Use References
	- Lean into subjectivity without a guide.
4. When learning information, context is important. What kind of genre does the person who is giving it work with? Learning is a process.
5. Train your ears: 
6. Practice Critical Listening: What am I hearing?
7. Master the Fundamentals: Volume Balancing, EQ, Compression / Limiting, Saturation, Reverb, Delay
8. Getting Reps. Practice. Cambridge Multi-Track Library.
9. Close Your Eyes. Listen.
10. Use References. As a Beginner, lean on them more. Try to replicate as an exercise.
11. Mix Fast: Set a deadline. It makes you more intentional.
12. Any workflow works.
13. Ask the right questions.
	- What am I hearing?
	- How does it make me feel?
	- What needs fixing?
	- What emotional aspects can I enhance?
	- Why am I doing this?


3 Levels of Compression: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETrLK0lH6aY
-----------------------
Beginner: Focuses only Ratio and Threshold
Simple Compression: Quick Attack time makes something sound thicker, slow makes it sound more aggressive.
If Transients are cutting through the mix too much, use a faster attack time.
Compression isn't always the tool you want to use. 
	- Limiting
	- Saturation
	- Clipping

5 Vocal Effects for a More Interesting Mix: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lQrSDVJQCs
------------------------------------------
- Think of Delay as a whole other instrument in the mix and make sure it fits.
- Brighter: Forward in the mix.
- Darker: Backward in the mix.
- Throw Delay: Copy the part of the track you want to throw, place it in a new lane, and move it forward to fill in empty space of the original track.
- Speaker Box Effect: Cut the low end and High End.
- Stereo Delay: Very light touch to make the vocal more powerful. Make sure the delay for left and right are different.

10 Grammy-Winning Secrets: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3bApEnoMk4
-------------------------
- Shape Vocals with a Multi-Band Compressor
- Use Delay to Widen and create movement on a panned instrument. Short Delay on one side, long delay on another.
- Serial De-ess.
- Splitting the lead vocal regions into different tracks based on different EQ Needs.
- EQ to cut bottom and boost top. Compress it. Second EQ. To Boost Low-end and cut top end to reduce harshness.
- EQ to boost sides. Bring the mids up.
- Blending Wet Effects for Vocals.
- Delay. Slight stagger of left and right to use stereo field.

Pro Mixer Demonstrates Fixing a Flat Mix: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf7YTtD5BRM
-----------------------------------------
- Panning
- Volume can Push the track back.
- EQ. Cutting the highs can push items back. [Lyu's Personal Note: This trick can also be used to make sounds appear to have a structure between them and the listener.]
	- As sounds get further away, the high ends get diminished.
- Reverb
- Delay: Ping-Pong to help make something that already has width also have more depth.
- Transients: Can cut through the mix. If you want a vocal further up in the mix, have a slower attack on a compressor so the transients pop through.


How to Use an Equalizer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHR7R-TY7NE
-----------------------
1. Sweep EQ (This can be done in Reverse)
2. Reference Tracks 
3. Gain Staging: Make sure the track is the same volume before and after EQ.
4. dbfs is what the DAW measures. It's too accurate. Human ears don't perceive it the same way. VU meters are less accurate, but are more accurate in relation to the ear. They detect averages.
5. The A/B test. Make sure to gain stage first. Hover your mouse over the bypass button. Click on and off the bypass a few times to disorient yourself. Back and forth test without knowing which is which.
6. The Good Philosophy behind a good EQ balance: EQ with purpose. In Mixing, a bunch of Tiny moves is what makes a good mix. Nothing is a rule, everything is a guideline.
7. Different kinds of EQs
	- Analog EQ: Physical Hardware. Gives sound color, i.e. subtle saturation. Saturation adds new frequencies.
	- Digital EQ: Provides accuracy but has no color.
	- Parametric EQ: Full control over Frequency, Q, and Loudness.
	- Semi-parametric EQ: Does not give control of the Q.
	- Graphic EQ: No control of frequency or width. But you get bands.
	- Minimum Phase EQ: EQ adjustments slightly alter the phase.
	- Linear EQ: Tools mostly for mastering engineers.
	- Stereo EQ: Basic EQ.
	- Mid/Side EQ: Focus on processing the mono channel, and then the sides separately. More advanced.
	- Static EQ: 99% of all EQ. Boost a band and it's always in effect.
	- Dynamic EQ: Only comes into effect when frequencies are too loud and move above the threshold. Used to fix odd tonality.
	- Regular EQ: Standard EQ.
	- Smart EQ: Balance the sound through AI.
8. The Chef Method for EQing the entire mix.
	- Clean your tracks.
	- Enhance your tracks. Can you more narrow EQ bands to undo parts of a boost you don't like. Bounce in place (Burn the effects into the actual track). Hide the original so you can use it again if you need to.
	- Set up volume balance. Create a Height Order: #1 Vocals, #2 Most Important Instrument, etc. Loop the loudest part of the track. Personal rule, -8.0 vocals. Start everything at 0.
	- Balance your mix's tone (EQ on the mix bus): "I want the whole mix to be x". Be subtle.
	- Blend your tracks. Where things start to sound like an actual mix. Fix masking. 3 rounds questions [3, 2, 1]. Do this in the context of the mix, not solo. To hear better, put a gain plugin at the end of each track and flip it on when needed. This should mostly be subtle. Keep the tone, but make a bit more space.
		- What are the most important sounds?
		- What are the instruments that should be in the background?
		- What instruments sound like they are masking one another? Use the mute method.
		- Where does each foreground instrument live in the spectrum?
		- Where does each background instrument live in the spectrum?
		- Which instruments are in similar octaves?
		- Step 1: Boost where the instrument should be dominant. Foreground instruments. Maybe background.
		- Step 2: Make a cut where the background should make room for the dominant. Mirror the boost. This is where you do tonal shaping with the filter.
		- Step 3: Use Pocket EQ with instruments that are in the same Octave. Cut and Boost, then reverse on the other one.
	- Make your final tweaks: Problem Solving Stage. 
9. Mix in Mono: Forces you to create balance and better clarity.
10. EQing Vocals: Be subtle if recording is good. When mixing harmonies, use same cuts as the main vocals. Make aggressive cut in upper-mids of harmony, look for most energy. Make it sit inside vocal. High Shelf or low pass. Cutting the top end makes something sound further back in the mix.


Vocal Delay and Reverb: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAS9QaU80nU
----------------------
- Why use them? Create more subtle space and creative effects.
- Bussing them allows more flexibility. Including send amount and volume.
- Sit the Vocal well in the mix: Rebalance, Short Reverb (lower than 1 second decay. Dependent on track, maybe try to have it decay between each word), Short Delay (Can be cleaner and stand out more in a thick mix), Add a Longer Reverb.
- Use EQ to shape the tone of the Reverb.
- Creating a sense of width: Short Reverb, Stereo Delay (Slightly Different timings on the left and right channels). Fix Masking for the vocal. Pre-delay on reverbs to separate dry and wet signal. Sidechain Compression to duck the volume of your wet FX whenever the vocal is present.
- Add Obvious and Creative Effects: Stack Delays and Reverbs to create Ambient Effect. Extra track just for throws. Use sidechain compression.


10 Mixing Tips Every Producer Should Know: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bm1E5K1qXU
----------------------------------------
1. Know the Three Dimensions of your mix: Height: Frequencies. Width: Panning. Depth: Distance.
2. Make sure to listen to a track in the context of a mix.
3. Look after your wellbeing...


10 Years of Mixing Advice in 10 Minutes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oY079oVS3Nc, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnT_9Xo3VDQ 
----------------------------------------
1. Phase can ruin a mix. Make sure waveforms are the same and not opposite. Ex, if one waveform on one track goes up and another goes down they will cancel one another out depending on the frequencies.
2. The 5 Click Rule: If it takes more than 5 clicks, find a way to automate or shortcut it.
3. Thinking for yourself when buying products.


10 Mixing Tips I Wish I Knew When I Started: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwubHAMfc2o
-------------------------------------------
1. Know your tools. Expensive plug-ins are not always better than stock.
2. Separate your bass into two stems.
3. Overdrive should be on a return track.
4. Put a soft-clipper on each group track before it hits the final limiter on the mix bus. Gives more headroom.


Sound Design Tips for Film, TV, Games, and Animation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcFmGYusunk
----------------------------------------------------
1. Fast Pitch Delay. Each repetition pitches down. -5, -7, or -12. Route that output into a reverb. (Valhalla Pitch Delay)


100 Tips for Pro Mixes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUYdVKIWJkQ
-----------------------
1. Normalize to -10 to -20
2. Volume Faders exhibit higher resolution near a nominal 0 db setting, offering finer control over adjustment.
3. Clip gain automation for vocals to make compression more natural.
4. Choose an anchor to volume balance around the rest of your tracks. For example, a kick at 8-10 db
5. Clip Gain for De-essing. Doing this before de-essing ensures the plugin does not need to work as hard.
6. Other Tips for De-essing: Layers of De-essing. Find the exact frequency and cut it out of just that one vocal. Pitch Down.
7. Add notes to tracks. In Ableton, Edit Info Text of a Track. Right Click Timeline, Add Locator.
8. Parallel Compression: Applying heavy compression to a copy of a signal and then blending that copied signal into the original signal. Gives greater control of shaping a sound and allowing it to cut through a dense mix. Carve out midrange and boost lows and highs of copy as well. Essentially feeds in power and energy (low and high). Can also automate mute to make it only work for certain sections.
9. Rear Bus Compression: Parallel compress everything in the mix aside from the drums and possibly the vocals. It acts as a subtle enhancement.
10. Parallel EQ. Kush Clariphonic EQ. Shape tone with Analog simulation EQ before other EQs.
11. Parallel Saturation can be used on anything. Decapitator plug-in.
12. Take intentional breaks when you are mixing. Sit back and recalibrate.
13. Listen & Takes Notes After Each Break. Can do it on a separate audio track armed to take your recordings.
14. Pre-delay to let share punch. When sounds are further away, we hear the dry and wet signal of Reverb more meshed together at the same time (Pre-delay). No Pre-delay emulates this. Can be used to place instruments to the front or back of your mix.
15. Use Sample Delays for Width: Exceptionally effective for enhancing Percussive Elements that occupy the higher end of the frequency spectrum. Haas Effect. Effectively making a copy and panning one hard left and the other hard right. Needs to be less than 40ms.
16. Chiaroscuro: The contrast between light and dark that creates the illusion of depth and realism in art and adds to the emotional experience of the viewer. Panning allows us to create contrast in the width dimension. LCR Panning: Hard Left, Hard Right, Dead Center. Depth allows sounds to feel further away by contrasting them with sounds that are closer.
17. Understand how EQ affects height. The lower the frequency, the lower the height. The higher the frequency, the higher the height. "Chakras" are activated via frequencies.
18. Use EQ to create depth in the mix. the further away sounds get, the darker in tone they get. This is why Reverbs often have a built-in high cut filter. The essences of a great mix lies in the artful staggering of your sounds through the right EQ adjustments. To ensure an instrument stands out while maintaining it's unique place, it's incredibly effective to selectively limit it's frequency range.
19. Low Cut + Low Shelf + Low Mid Cut
20. Abbey Road Reverb Trick: Roll off the low end the high end of your reverb to a desired place. High End: Darken the Reverb to a degree that is desired to push the sound back in the mix.
21. De-Esser Before Reverb to get rid of splashiness.
22. Delay after reverb to give it more width and depth. UAD Lexicon plugin.
23. Tremolo after Reverb. Longer sustained instruments and sounds. Similar to Ping Pong Effect except you can control depth.
24. Compressing your Reverb: Downward or Upward. MV2 plugin. 
25. Automate the Reverb. Up in the chorus, for example. Stops the reverb from being too powerful or too weak.
26. Three Reverb Buckets: Vocals, Drums, Other. Create contrasting areas of depth. Use a different reverb for each of the 3 main instrument groups. For each instrument bucket, create a long and short version of the reverb. Long Reverb is at least 1 second, anything less is short. Intentionally apply any other tone or character shaping to the reverbs [EQ, Delay, Etc]. Some can be more narrow than others, some can be darker.
27. Create Contrast with Wide and Narrow Reverbs: As sounds are perceived to be further away, they become more narrow in the stereo field. Sounds that are closer to listeners have a more direct path to their ears, making it so they can be more distinctly placed. As sounds get further away, the direct sound decreases in volume and the reverberation volume increases. The reflections start to fill the stereo field. High frequencies are absorbed more quickly by the air then low frequencies. To create distance, roll off high end, increase decay time, and narrow stereo field.
28. Organize Your Plugins!!!!! Ex. Amps and Pedals, Delay, Distort/Clip/Saturate, EQ, Filter, Imaging, Metering, Modulation/Chorus, Multi Effects, Pitch, Preamp/Channel Strip, Reverb, Specialized, Utility
29. It's Correct, If That's how you [or the client] likes it! Taste is everything. "It's important that you understand the delineation between the correct way to do something and whether your like it or not" The only real rules that exist in audio are those that exist within the physics of acoustics. If it sounds good, it is good.
30. Know your room!!! No matter how accurate and controlled your get your room to sound, you're never going to get mixes to translate unless you spend adequate time learning that room. Test your music on speakers outside of the studio. Listen to references. Listen to those references before mixing [2-5 Tracks]. Car Checks. Low end frequencies tend to travel right out of the window. They can go through thin material easily.
31. How to find the sweet spot in your studio: Harmon Room Mode Calculator. Alt. Measure 33% length of your room and use that as the starting point. Square rooms are very difficult. Possibly use headphones instead. Anything Sonarworks recommends for $200 on their website is reliable. Set speaks in an equilateral triangle from that position. At least 45 inches apart. Room EQ Wizard for testing. Aim for a Frequency Response that is +-6 db of Flat and a decay times less than 200ms below 200HZ frequencies. SPL Meter helps you find where problem frequencies are in your room, which is where you place your acoustic treatment.
32. Pan Two Different Tonal Reverbs Left and Right. Keep the Decay's time similar. Works well with swelling sounds, like Synths and Pads.
33. Pan Reverb/Delay to one side, dry to the other.
34. Volume Automate the end of the phrase to create depth.
35. Clipping instead of Compression for Rhythmic Transients: Preserves headroom and makes it brighter by adding a bit of distortion.
36. Side-chain compression for kick drum. Soothe 2.
37. Side-Chain Reverb Ducking. Allows the vocals to momentarily reduce the reverb as the come in, and then release once they cease, ensuring the vocals pierce through the reverb, maintaining their clarity and forward position in the mix.
38. Long Dark Reverb: EQ Feeding Into Reverb Feeding Into Echo. Carve out high and low ends far. Reverb also EQs the lows and highs further. Short Decay time. Add wide delay with 1/4th delay time.
39. Understand How EQ Adds to Transients: EQ Before Clipper (BitCrusher plugin) makes it "louder" and punchier, even if it doesn't sound like it in solo. It keeps headroom.
40. Reference Stems From Popular Songs: SPLICE, LOOPMASTERS, SKIO MUSIC AND METAPOP, BANDCAMP, SOUNDCLOUD, PRODUCER/ARTIST WEBSITES, PRODUCELIKEAPRO, PRODUCEATHON COMMUNITY, LABEL PROMOTIONS via Social Media or Website
41. Make Friends with Phase: The timing relationship between two waves at any point in time. Constructive and Destructive Interference. Easy solution can be to invert the phase, though sometimes you have to manually align.
42. The Right Way to Hi-Pass: Go too far then drag it back slowly in the context of the mix.
43. Boost the Fundamental of Kick & Snare into a Clipper for maximum punch.
44. Use Dynamic and Static EQ on Vox Fundamental
45. Fletcher Munson Curve and EQ: Ears perceive frequencies in the 1-5k range to be much louder, even when played at the same volume. Perceived volume differs from actual volume. Also called the Equal Loudness Contours. Magic of great mixes is in the midrange.
46. When using a reference track, you can narrow the frequency bands through EQ to better match your track to it.
47. Class Pultec EQP-1A: Tightening and cleaning the bass.
48. Different EQ for different sections of the song: Can automate EQ cuts/boosts.
49. Tilt EQ is useful for quickly brightening/darkening sounds.
50. Adopt a "Fix-first" mindset. Before you can enhance a track, you must first fix the issues. Sonic and Dynamic Spectrum. EQ/Volume adjustment, compression, clipping, and limiting. Enhancements injects the mix with tone and character and can range from subtle to bold. Akin to painting on a blank canvas.
51. How to hear problems? Ear training and practice. "What's just as important as being able to identify a problem is the ability to identify when there are no problems or issues to address." When Search and Destroying, don't look for problems. Identify that they exist, and THEN find them. When boosting, never boost more than 12 decibels.
52. Tremolo On High End creates width. Depth determines how much of the other end it gets. If 50%, the starting end will have more than the alternating end. 
53. Compression for Depth: Has a great ability to shape the front-end transient on a snare.
54. Know your Compressor! Different compressor types have different characters. Especially around Attack and Release.
55. Mixing Mindset When Recording and Producing: Songwriting and Arrangement. Think about how each element sits in the mix. A well-recorded track needs less cleaning in a final mix. Select sounds that compliment one another and fill the frequency spectrum. If all of these steps are done with care, a significant portion of the mixing process can be done with just volume faders.
56. Modulation in Reverb: "Depth in Reverb + Rate" Can smooth sounds out and be used for creative effects.
57. Chorus After Reverb: MicroShift plugin. Create additional spaciness.
58. Transient Shaping with Compression: Shape and change release times.  
59. Polyverse Wider Plugin: Free. Helps fix phase issues with mono.
60. Correlation Meter - Don't overstress about Phase! As long as it's above 80% of the time, it's fine. Centering other instruments helps offset it.
61. Consider Limiters over Compressors: Fast attack and release make it very transparent in how it cuts off transients.
62. Console Emulation: Putting them on your tracks is essentially summing. Adds color. How hot you drive the sound into it determines the color. 8 channels or more is when you really start to notice the sound.
63. Know the different saturation types.
64. Parallel Distortion on the Mix-Bus.
65. Tape Saturation to get rid of Harshness: Tape is great at softening.
66. Phase Invert to hear the difference
67. Parallel Exciter on Vocals
68. Attenuation Select EQP1A
69. Low-Pass on Vocals: Don't be afraid to use aggressive filtering on vocals that need it.
70. Drum Replacement/Layering: Battery 4 plugin. Create replacement/double drums if you receive a bad track
71. 808 Saturation + Chorus + Limiting: Micro-shift Chorus Plugin. Focus know sets everything below the frequency threshold Mono.
72. When to Kick the Kick out of the drum bus
73. Bus Compression (VCA Compression) on drum bus to glue them together.
74. Short Ambience on Percussion: Helps create separation and depth
75. Short Decay/Ambience on Backing Vocals: Blend it in slightly to give it depth behind the lead vocal. 
76. How to Mid/Side: Fabfilter Pro-Q3. 
77. Contrast in Action: The difference between light and dark is what makes light feel brighter. Restrict the three dimensions of a mix to have an impact of power and expansion. Narrow in the stereo-field of a few instruments. Automate the closing and opening of that element of the mix. An example would be to have it be narrow before the chorus and widen when it switches to it.
78. Linear Phase High-Pass on Kick
79. Mix with the Master in Mind: Mindset. Two things involved with mastering, the Sonic Spectrum and the Dynamic Spectrum. Sonic Tools: EQ and Saturation. Dynamic Tools: Compressors, Clippers, and Limiters. Keep the end in mind while mixing. Frequency imbalance and Peaks are the two largest enemies to loudness.


How To Use Compression: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksJRgK3viMc
----------------------
- A smart volume fader.
- Usually used to squish the highs and lows together.
- 4 Goals of Compression: To Balance, To Enhance, To Glue, To Fix.
- To Balance for a Good Mix you need to balance The Tone, The Space, and The Dynamics. EQ, Reverb/Panning/Delay, Volume and Compressors.
- Balance Compression: Balances the Dynamics of each individual instrument.
- Tonal Compression: Compression that is there to change the sound's tone. 
- Glue Compression: Bring all of the instruments together and make them feel cohesive.
- Music Dynamics: The range of volume between the loudest part of the song and the quietest part of the song. Shape of a song.
- Macro Dynamics: The difference between the loudest note in a track's performance and the quietest note. Shape of an instruments musical performance.
- Micro Dynamics: The range of volume between the loudest moment and the quietest moment in each and every note an instrument makes. Shape of the note.
- Volume Envelope: The unique pattern of loudness that's made by each instrument.
- Sustain: The valley of the note.
- Transient: The peak of the note.
- Good Compression Comes in Layers: Each of the layers is accomplishing a different goal and each of them is subtle.
- Anatomy of a Compressor: 
--Threshold: Sets the volume level that turns the compressor on.
--Ratio: How hard the compressor works. How aggressive. The higher the ratio, the more gain reduction you get.
--Gain Reduction Meter: Visually shows how much compression is being done.
--Attack: The amount of time it takes for the compressor to apply the full dose of compression.
--Release: The amount of time it takes for the compressor to fully recover from gain reduction.
--Make-Up Gain: Turning the Volume up. Making the quiet sounds louder.
--Knee: Turn the threshold from a single number to a range of number. A hard-knee (0) is a more accurate compressor but is obvious, a soft-knee (1) is a less accurate compressor but is more subtle.
--Auto: Ignore the Release knob, release when the compressor thinks it should release.
--Mix Knob: Mix the Dry Signal with the Wet Signal
- Threshold and Ratio:
-- Threshold: Choose the part of the micro-dynamics you want to target.
-- Ratio: The higher the more compression occurs. For every Xdb that goes in, 1db is released from the Compressor.
-- At the ratio gets higher, the amount of gain it reduces gets lower. 8:1 -> 1 - 1/8 -> 7/8 -> 88% volume decrease of what goes over the threshold.
- Attack and Release: Do the most shaping. Are rates, not delays. Rate of change. Think of it like a linear curve.
-- Attack: The amount of time it takes for the compressor to apply the full does of compression after a sound has gone above the threshold. Slowly turns the ratio up over the attack time, say from 1:1 to 4:1.
-- Release: The amount of time it takes for the compressor to fully recover from the gain compression.
-- Fast Attack: Grabs your peaks really hard.
-- Slow Attack: Lets your peaks pass through relatively uncompressed.
-- Fast Release: Makes the compressor more dramatic.
-- Slow Release: Makes the compressor more transparent by keeping the dynamics relatively the same.
-- Attack times:
--- Fast: 1us to 1000us
--- Medium: 1ms - 10ms
--- Slow: 10ms - 100ms. Starts to get into the valley.
-- Release:
--- Fast: 0ms - 100ms
--- Medium: 100ms - 500ms
--- Slow: 500ms - 20 seconds
- Make-up Gain:
-- Just a volume know that increases the output.
-- All a compressor knows how to do is turn loud sounds down.
-- Turn our now turned-down sound back up.
-- Usually want overall level to be the same pre and post compression.
-- Sometimes you want the peaks to be at the same level they were before, sometimes the valleys.
- Sidechain: The ears of the compressor.
-- There is only one sidechain, but there are two different sources.
--- Internal Source: Listening to the channel the plugin is on.
---- Sidechain filtering: Just tells the sidechain "Hey I want you to ignore this part of the FQ spectrum". Can make it sound more natural in the low-end.
--- External Source: Listen to a different instrument and act like it was compressing that instead.
---- What people usually refer to as "sidechaining". Helps to keep balance by dropping the db of one thing as another hits the threshold.
- Lesser used parameters
-- Knee: Turn the threshold into a range. Like a hazy cloud the sound passes through, eventually reaching the threshold. Helps it feel more subtle and natural. Ratio shifts throughout the cloud. Changes from a liner slope to a more parabolic one. Add it after everything else. Percussion usually prefers hard-knee, string instruments can benefit from a soft one due to sustain.
-- Range: Affects the amount of compression being applied. Sets the upper limit of compression that can be applied. Helps keep transients intact. Usually in de-essers. Alternative to a mix-knob.
-- Hold: Prolongs the peaks in gain-reduction. Rounds out the top of your gain-reduction. Usually found in noise-gates. Takes it from a sharp spike to more of a curved mountain.
-- Lookahead: Anticipates peaks and starts to reduce the gain a few milliseconds early. Delays the entire track. Helps achieve loudness without decreasing clarity. More on Utility Compressors like Limiters where colorless gain reduction is the most important.
- Combining it
-- Thickness usually comes from a high valley.
-- Punchiness comes from loud peaks and quiet valleys.
- Styles of Compression
-- Consistency
--- Rebalance macro-dynamics. Level-balancing.
--- High Threshold, fast attack, slow release.
--- Match Release to BPM. The Lyons' Den Delay Time Calculator.
--- Very subtle. Serial-compression can be good here.
--- Do I want my make-up gain to match the peaks or valleys?
-- Thickness
--- Gives a lot of loudness.
--- Set the threshold to only catch the peaks.
--- Fast attack. Fast Release. 
--- Make-up Gain to hit top of peak.
-- Groove
--- Accentuates the accents of an instrument by introducing pumping. Can wreck a track.
--- Slow Attack, Fast Release, Low Threshold. 
--- Threshold beneath valleys.
--- Make-up gain to the same as before.
--- This has to be timed to the tempo.
-- Punch
--- Increasing the impact of the peaks.
--- Changes the micro-dynamics.
--- Slow Attack, Slow Release, Low Threshold.
--- Threshold to beneath the peaks.
--- Attack should allow peaks through.
--- Release should last until next note.
--- Make-up gain should match initial.
- How to set up your compressor
-- Zero out your compressor. Thresh: 0, Ratio: Max, Attack and Release: Max, if Knee: 0.0.
-- Adjust the threshold
-- Adjust your attack and release.
-- Adjust your knee if you have one.
-- Adjust ratio to taste.
-- Adjust your make-up gain.
- How to Create Depth.
-- Soundwaves lose their transient properties the longer they go on. Peaks get quieter the further away sound travels. Smaller dynamic range is further away, closer is higher.
-- Always gain stage to original loudness. Only changing peaks.
-- The louder something is, the closer it appears to be.
- How to Create Headroom
-- Turn down the peaks of certain sounds.
-- Saturation is a different type of compressor.
-- Adds distortion and compresses peaks
- Remove Room Sound
-- Turn down the valleys of the sound.
-- Going to be losing some tone.
-- Slow Attack, Slow Release, Low Threshold. Match output gain to peak level.
- What compression style should I use?
-- To Balance
--- Use Consistency or Depth style (Closer/Farther)
-- To Enhance
--- Punchy, Thick, Groove
-- To Glue
--- Consistent, Depth (Farther), Groove
-- To Fix
--- Create Headroom
--- Turn Down Room Sound
- What Does Over Compression sound like
-- If you can hear the compression, and it's not your goal, you overdid it.
-- Pumping: Fast Release in compressor that causes unnatural dip in DB. Caused by using too heavy of a ratio on Groove Style.
-- Breathing / Splat: Breathing is on sustain instruments. Compressor clamps down and has a very slow release. Sustain louder than transient. Splat means peaks are becoming unfocused. Caused by a low threshold targeting both the peaks and valleys in a Consistency style compression.
-- Brickwalling / Lifelessness : BW. Fast attack, slow release, but has a low threshold. Thickness style of compression leads to it. Turns down peaks so they are at the same level of the valley. If added to a sound that has a lot of dynamics, it will suck the life out of it.
-- Inconsistency: Occurs when you are compressing on an overly dynamic track. Punchy style of compression with an aggressive ratio.
- How to Compress Any Instrument
-- Figure out your goal.
-- Decide on a Compression Style
-- Find our style's settings
-- Find your Peaks and Valleys. Use Threshold and makes sure it hits back to zero.
-- Set up Your Compressor
- How Fast are the Peaks?
-- These ranges only show how long it takes to get from no sound to the loudest part of the sound.
-- Percussive:
---1ms - 10ms
-- Rhythmic:
---10ms - 40ms
-- Sustained:
---15ms - 60ms
-- Use the Slope of the note to visually check it.
- Serial Compression
-- Stack multiple compressors in a row.
- Parallel Compression: Put the compressor on a send and mix it in subtly.
-- Usually works best with Analog compressor since the goal is color.
