Gain Staging: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq5lDHCKt84
------------
- Gain Staging: The pre-mix process of changing the gain of all of your recordings so that they sit around the same level.
- It is not volume balancing. Gain and volume are not the same.
- The volume of a track is how loud a track is after processing. The gain is how loud a track is before it's been processed.
- Gain is your input level, volume is your output level.
- Changing your volume doesn't mean changing your gain.
- How do you change gain? Add a plugin at the top of a channel / Or use the DAWs gain system.
- What should you change the gain to? 0dBVU. Use a VU Meter Plugin. Stage one track of a time. Loop the loudest part and make sure it sits at around 0. If it's dynamic, use the peaks.
- Sometimes you cannot get an item into the sweet spot due to digital clipping. Get it as close as possible.
- The more plugins a track will use, the better it will sound if you gain stage a recording. After practice, you should try to knock it out in less than 10 minutes.


Low End: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pGtnRIyusA
-------
- Shelf EQ to boost everything BUT the low end to make it cut through the mix better. Fletcher-Munson Curve


EQ Advice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrUpFF7nlOg
----------
- Balance Chart
- Seesaw Effect: Sometimes if you hear a problem on one end of the spectrum, the actual solution may be on the opposite side.


Gain Automation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aun6XN63Jvo
---------------
- When you automate the gain level of an audio file so that it averages the same level throughout the song.
- Automate areas of lower gain to match higher
- Peak doesn't matter. Average level should try to match.
- Volume automation AFTER gain automation can fix a problem with it sounding worse. Gain automation creates a consistent tone, volume automation helps with dynamics.
- Example: Boost gain on an instrument then lower volume back down.


How Fast Are Transients: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg4_vl65RxM
-----------------------
Attack Times on Compressors: Can be used to miss the initial transient. Timing is based on slope.


Ultimate Recording Checklist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjalL7csm5M
----------------------------
- Do A Take. Do I like it, yes or no?
- No, redo. Yes, keep.
- Listen to it bit by bit. If there are parts you don't like, punch them in (record over them).


Which Mixing Plugins to Upgrade First: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7UEwA-U73I
-------------------------------------
- Saturation Plugins: Fabfilter Saturn
- Reverb Plugins: Liquidsonic - Seventh Heaven, Valhalla Vintage
- Amp Simulator: Positive Grid - Bias Amp
- TDR Kotelnikov Compressor
- Loudmax Limiter


Your Vocals Are Too Loud: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWskyKzGvpc
------------------------
- Step 1: Create Brightness - Sounds that are brighter sound closer to the ear. Shelf on High End.
- Step 2: Create Consistency - Compression. Fast Attack, Slow Release, High Threshold.
   - Serial Compression: One compressor after the other with a lower threshold to smooth it down.
- Step 3: Get Rid of Masking
   - Masking: The perception of one sound is affected by the presence of another. Happens if they have a similar frequency.
   - Mute Button Method: 
      - Mute your instruments one at a time.
      - Listen to the vocal, not the instruments.
      - Ask yourself: Is the vocal suddenly louder or more present?
      - If not, then there's no masking between those two tracks.
      - If so, then masking is occurring.
      - Cut with EQ
- Step 4: Volume Balancing
   - Set your vocal level, set it down a few DB. Forces you to create perceived loudness.


How to Compress Vocals: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og8tYrFWazE
----------------------
1. Prep the Tracks before compression
	- Clip gain automation early on.
2. Remove Unwanted Frequencies
3. Tame the Peaks (First Compressor)
4. Add Further Consistency (Second Compressor). The use Make-up Gain
5. Add Excitement (Third Compressor). Slow attack time
6. Add Character. This is done through compressor types.
   - Examples: FET for peak, OPTO for consistency, FET for excitement.


Simple Mixing Workflow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKrF2dra1S0
----------------------
1. Session Prep
	- Organize Tracks, Group similar tracks together, Color-coding, Labeling song sections, Gain Staging, Selecting Reference Tracks, Setting Buffer Size to it's highest limit.
2. Initial Balance
	- Faders and Panning. Get the best mix you can with just those.
3. Mix Bus
	- Add effects to here first.
4. Process Top down
	- Process Parent busses first, then process each individual channel as needed.
	- How is the tone? -> How are the dynamics? -> Does it need space?
5. Listen throughs
	- Listen through everything, beginning to end. Take notes on what needs to be fixed. Make Revisions. 3-5 Rounds.
6. Evaluate Translation
	- Make sure it sounds well on any system.
	- Use a Frequency Analyzer to check how closer yours is to the reference.
	- Add EQ at the end of Mix Bus Chain to nudge it as close as you can.
	- Choose any 3 Speaker Systems and play your mix in a playlist next to the reference track. Note any red flags. Phone, Bluetooth Speaker, Earbuds, etc.

Vocal Chain Order: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpaAijC4By0
-----------------
- Subtractive EQ -> Address Dynamics (Compression) -> Boost Please Frequencies (Additive EQ) -> Space and Depth (Reverb and Delay)

- Advanced: Tame Sibilance (Add after Additive before Wet Effects) -> Volume Automate (Use Gain Plugin to Automate instead of volume fader) -> Add Character (Compressor Types and Saturation)
	- Add Saturation first in the chain

Getting Weird with Parallel Compression: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRkMvuNZ8_E
---------------------------------------
1. Add Saturation to a parallel compressed track. Antares
2. Use Modulation and Automate it during specific parts
3. Use Pitch Shift. Antares Avox Mutator


Are Your Ears Broken: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VRsYNX5RdM
---------------------
1. Train your ears a little bit everyday.
2. Frequency is key.
3. Keep it quick and consistent.
4. Drills -> Analysis. (10 - 30 minutes)
	Drills: Soundgym.co / Other ear training websites
	Analysis: Remove Distractions. Pick a reference. Takes notes on what you hear. 
		Categories: Song: Pick
			    Tone: What's bright? What is dark? Overall? Are vocals crisp and up-front?
			    Balance: Volume Balance and Panning. What is up-front? Back? Where are things panned?
		            Dynamics: How punchy is it? How compressed?
			    Space: What kind of reverbs> Where is delay? Wet or dry mix? How is space used? What is the sense of depth?
			    Notes: Anything Else.

Compression, Limiting, and Clipping: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pKbIRxhxIw
------------------------------------
1. Compression: Like Limiters by more options.
2. Limiter: Sound can't get any louder than the threshold.
3. Clipper: Chops the tops off of the peaks.

Do you Need a Mix Bus Compression? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5aHSV_aTWs
----------------------------------
1. Limiters and Clippers faster and easier.
2. Multi-Band Compression as a way to shape the tone. Use it when you like part of the sound, but don't like other parts of it.

Stop High Passing Everything: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bJrPtXYNtI
----------------------------
1. Shelving instead of always doing high/low passes.
2. Retains some of the harmonics by limiting it.

--------------------------------------------------

Music: Pitch Correction -> EQ -> Compression -> De-Esser (Can also be chained) -> Reverb -> Delay
Compression: More makes it upfront at the cost of losing Energy. Less makes it further but it has more energy. Gain staging helps reduce this
Can Automate Reverb to come in on empty spaces
Delay before a reverb. High Pass, Pull it up. Low Pass, Pull it down. Gets it out of the way of the lead vocal.
Delays are a better alternative to Reverb in a busy mix. Unsync Delay from BPM IF you want to hear it better. May not be often.
Flanger: Add Width. Helps if you did not record doubles or triples.
Formant Shifter: Change sound of voice without touching voice.
Sample Vocals: Take a portion of lead vocal, put it on a new track, put it into a sampler. Slice. Sensitivity Down to the Transients. Can then play on the Piano.
LFO: Emulating Side chains or Rhythmic Stuttering
Creative Bussing
Reversing Vocals: Take First Part of Lead Vocal. Drag to new track. Turn on Reverb. Crank it Up. Bounce it in place. Extend the Tail. Reverse the Track. Creates a Vocal Swell.
Distortion: Heavier form of Saturation. Can add grittiness and Energy to a vocal.
Doubles and Triples: Record the same part multiple times. Pan them hard left and hard right. Add a bit of EQ (Usually High Shelf) and make them more tuned.
More Energy can be achieved through recording the other vocal parts and octave up or an octave down.
Mixing Vocals: Mix into a limiter. Mix in Mono (Music only) at really low volumes.
Don't Solo Vocals.
Send all your instruments into a submix then sidechain it with the vocals. Dips out some range.
Editing: Get rid of plosives through fading
Recording: Closer you are, the boomier it is. The further you are, the thinner it is.
Record to a drum beat, not a metronome.


13 Mixing Tips: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCbugYCROCo
--------------
1. Cannot make a 5/10 -> 10/10. At most, 8/10 -> 10/10.
2. Learn technical then creative.
3. You cannot derive an ought from an is. What you do with something is totally subjective.
	- Use References
	- Lean into subjectivity without a guide.
4. When learning information, context is important. What kind of genre does the person who is giving it work with? Learning is a process.
5. Train your ears: 
6. Practice Critical Listening: What am I hearing?
7. Master the Fundamentals: Volume Balancing, EQ, Compression / Limiting, Saturation, Reverb, Delay
8. Getting Reps. Practice. Cambridge Multi-Track Library.
9. Close Your Eyes. Listen.
10. Use References. As a Beginner, lean on them more. Try to replicate as an exercise.
11. Mix Fast: Set a deadline. It makes you more intentional.
12. Any workflow works.
13. Ask the right questions.
	- What am I hearing?
	- How does it make me feel?
	- What needs fixing?
	- What emotional aspects can I enhance?
	- Why am I doing this?


3 Levels of Compression: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETrLK0lH6aY
-----------------------
Beginner: Focuses only Ratio and Threshold
Simple Compression: Quick Attack time makes something sound thicker, slow makes it sound more aggressive.
If Transients are cutting through the mix too much, use a faster attack time.
Compression isn't always the tool you want to use. 
	- Limiting
	- Saturation
	- Clipping

5 Vocal Effects for a More Interesting Mix: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lQrSDVJQCs
------------------------------------------
- Think of Delay as a whole other instrument in the mix and make sure it fits.
- Brighter: Forward in the mix.
- Darker: Backward in the mix.
- Throw Delay: Copy the part of the track you want to throw, place it in a new lane, and move it forward to fill in empty space of the original track.
- Speaker Box Effect: Cut the low end and High End.
- Stereo Delay: Very light touch to make the vocal more powerful. Make sure the delay for left and right are different.

- Shape Vocals with a Multi-Band Compressor
- Use Delay to Widen and create movement on a panned instrument. Short Delay on one side, long delay on another.
- Serial De-ess.
- Splitting the lead vocal regions into different tracks based on different EQ Needs.
- EQ to cut bottom and boost top. Compress it. Second EQ. To Boost Low-end and cut top end to reduce harshness.
- EQ to boost sides. Bring the mids up.
- Blending Wet Effects for Vocals.
- Delay. Slight stagger of left and right to use stereo field.

Pro Mixer Demonstrates Fixing a Flat Mix: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf7YTtD5BRM
-----------------------------------------
- Panning
- Volume can Push the track back.
- EQ. Cutting the highs can push items back. [Lyu's Personal Note: This trick can also be used to make sounds appear to have a structure between them and the listener.]
	- As sounds get further away, the high ends get diminished.
- Reverb
- Delay: Ping-Pong to help make something that already has width also have more depth.
- Transients: Can cut through the mix. If you want a vocal further up in the mix, have a slower attack on a compressor so the transients pop through.
