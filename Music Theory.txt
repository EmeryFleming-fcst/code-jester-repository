---------------------------
- If two of the same letter and missing one, use the other version. Flat and Sharp.
- Scale Degrees:
-- Note you start on is 1. Counting up increases by 1.
- Harmonic Minor:
-- Sharp the 7th note. If the note is a flat, cancel the flat and it returns to base. 
- Natural Minor:
-- Normal irregular. Not sharp, not flat. As it occurs from the original pattern.
- Melodic Minor: 
-- On the way up, sharp the 6th and 7th scale degree.
-- On the way down, play the natural minor scale.
- Intervals: The major of musical distance.
-- Major, Minor, Augmented, Diminished, and Perfect
-- Major is a full step. Minor is a half step smaller.
-- If you ever want to turn a major step into a minor step, lower the higher step by a 1/2 step.
-- Perfect 4th and Perfect 5th.
-- Tritons is a special interval. Chromatic Scale: C to Gb
-- Major C (Lower) -> Minor Eb -> (Lower) Diminished Ebb. The name will imply the function.
-- Major C (Raise) -> Augmented E#
-- Perfect intervals skip the minor. Major C -> Diminished Gb && Augmented G#.
- Melody and Transposition
-- Uses scales as building blocks.
-- A melody is a single line of music.
-- F Major Scale: F G A Bb C D E F. Melody Examples: 144351
-- When using a scale to build a melody or chord progression, that's called playing in a key.
- Chords
-- Chords are built off of patterns.
-- Triad: Take the root note. Do every other note.
--- Major/Minor Triads: If you want to make a major tried a minor triad, just lower the middle note by a 1/2 step.
- Chord Progressions
-- Building Chords based off of the same scale and progressing from one to the next.
-- Chords are named off of their base note
-- A Major Scale: A B C# D E F# G#
-- A Major Chord: A C# E
-- 4th Scale Degree: D F# A
-- 2nd Scale Degree: B D F#
-- 5th Scale Degree: E G# B
-- Can build melodies from this type of grid.
-- 3 Part Harmony: Cello, Viola, Violin. 
-- Cello Plays: A A B B. Viola: C# D D E. Violin: E F# F# G#
- Roman Numerals and Chord Transposition
-- Lowercase Numeral: Minor. Uppercase Numeral: Major
-- All Major Scale Chords: I ii iii IV V vi vii^
-- All Minor Scale Chords: i ii^ III iv v VI VII
- Tritone: An augmented fourth or a diminished 5th. Can also take any note and go up 3 whole steps.
-- Serves as a function. It's unstable sound wants to move. Either note will either move outwards or inwards.
-- Perfectly Symmetrical. Each chord contains at least on Tritone.
-- Can be used to make chords after the resolution.
- Chords and their functions
-- Major Chord:
-- Sus4 Chord: Trade the 3 for a 4.
-- Sus2 Chord: Trade the 3 for a 2.
-- Minor Chord:
-- Augmented Chord: 
--- Raise the 5th
-- Diminished Chord:
--- Lower the third and 5th.
-- Dominant Chord:
--- Built off of the 5th scale degree. Take 4 notes instead of 3.
-- Chords with notes added on past the active:
--- Numbers > 8. New notes have a greater active.
-- Diminished 7th Chord
--- I ii iii iv. Lower 5 and 7 to flats.
- Inverting Intervals
-- Take the lower note of a pair and make it an octave higher.
-- All M3 become m6. 2 -> 7, 4 -> 5 (Remains Perfect)
- Inverting Chords
-- Take the lowest note and make it an octave higher.
-- For first inversion, numeral has a 6 next to it. Interval of 6 from new base note.
-- For second inversion, 6/4.
-- Invert 7 chord: 6/5. 4/3. 4/2
- The circle of fifths:
-- C G D A E B F# C#/Db Ab Bb F
-- When deriving a scale using the 5th interval, the 4th becomes the 7th#
-- Ends with all #s.
-- C# can become Db and becomes Db Major Scale
-- Reverse and starts turning the 4th flat into a normal 7th.
-- Key Signatures tell you which accidentals belong in each scale.
-- Order of sharps: F# C# G# D# A# E# B#
-- To figure out Key Signature. Take the Root Node and go half step lower.
--- Examples: Root node D has a F# and C# (Everything to the right, inclusive)
-- To figure out Key Signature for a flat scale: Bb Eb Ab Db Gb Cb Fb
-- It'll be the second to last note you see.
-- F major contains only a Bb.
- Modulation and Borrowing
-- Secondary Dominant
-- Borrow Tritone from another chord that resolves to the next chord.
-- Harmonize a Melody that Borrows from another Key
--- C D Eb D. Borrows Eb from bIII.
-- Switching between Chords entirely by borrowing a chord that is common between both keys.
- Modes: Scales derives from key signatures.
-- G Major: F#.
-- Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, Locrian. The note you start on. From 1 - 7. Wraps around.
-- How to make a Major scale into a mode:
--- Ionian is a major.
--- Dorian, flat the 3rd and 7th.
--- Phrygian: Flat 2, 3, 6, 7.
--- Lydian: #4.
--- Mixolydian: b7
--- Locrian: b2, b3, b5, b6, b7

------------
Consonances and Dissonances:
- The simpler the ratio between the frequencies are the more consonant they are.
- 220Hz. Next ration would be 2:1 at 440, 3:1 at 660hz, 4:1 at 880Hz. This is harmonic series.
- The ratio us how often they will sync up over x period.
- Purity of a Consonance: Absence of beating when two sounds play together.
- Any time you divide or multiply a note by two, you are getting the same not but an octave higher or lower.
- Create a scale:
-- Start with 440hz, or A.
-- Multiple by 3 and then divide by 2: 146,66 | 440 | 1320 -> 293.33 | 440 | 660
-- Same as above: (97.77 | 293.33 | 440 | 660 | 1980) % 2 = (391.11 | 586.66 | 440 | 660 | 495)
-- Final: 391.11 | 440 | 495 | 586.66 | 660 = Pentatonic Scale. G A B D E (G-Major/E-Minor Pentatonic Scale)
-- Adding two more notes gives 521.48 and 742.5. C and F#. G-Major Scale.
-- First note is called the Tonic. Rest are 2nd, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, etc.
-- Next note after is the 8ve. Same note of the tonic
-- Compare to Harmonic Series:
--- 1:1 - Tonic / G
--- 2:1 - 2nd / A
--- 3:1 - 3rd / B
--- 4:1 - 4th / C
--- 5:1 - 5th / D
--- 6:1 - 6th / E
--- 7:1 - 7th / F#
--- 8:1 - 8ve / G
- Within a sound, the lower frequency is called the fundamental.
- All other frequencies are called the overtones.
-- Harmonic Overtones: Participate with the sound. Part of the harmonic series.
-- Inharmonic Overtones: Participate with the tone of the sound. 
- White noise is 100% inharmonic sounds.
- Overtones are the reason a piano and trumpet sound different.
- In a Major scale, the most consonant sounds with the Tonic are the 4th and the 5th, then the third and the sixth, and then the 2nd and the 7th
- The more consonant a sound is, the more overtones they have in common.
- To get the fifth of a note: F(Note) x 3 / 2(or 4)
- The Circle of fifths:
-- C264 x3/2 -> G396 x3/4 -> D297 x3/2 -> A445.5 x3/4 -> E334.125 x3/2 -> B501.188 x3/4 -> F#375.89 -> DFlat281.918 -> AFlat422.877 -> EFlat317.158 -> BFlat475.737 -> F356.803
- How we tune an instrument is called temperament. The way of tuning via the circle of fifths is called the Pythagorean temperament.
- A problem: After F if we try to continue to add another 5th, it should return to the tonic. However, it overshoots it and must be squished causing it to become dissonant (The Wolf Interval)
- Another problem: There was a difference between the third in the temperament and the third in the natural harmonic series.
- To solve this, Meantone Temperaments:
-- The difference in the third(which was 4 consecutive 5ths) is called the comma. Lower each 5th by 1/4 of a comma. Third becomes pure, but sacrifices the fifths.
-- 1/6 or 1/8 instead. Brings it closer to the comma, sacrifices the purity of 1/3rd
- Equal Temperament
-- Every note in the chromatic scale is separated by an equal interval, such as 1/12 octave. All notes are slightly offset, same with intervals, but it makes all fifths and thirds equally consonant.
-- Can now transpose any song in any key without having to retain our instrument.
- Octave is divided into 12 different intervals, so 12 notes.
- Excluding Major and Minor there are 7 notes: CDEFGABC
- Name of Scale Dependent on the Fundamental and How the Note is spaced
- C Major Scale:
-- C Fundamental
-- Major: 1 1 1/2 1 1 1 1/2 tones (Intervals between keys)
- Minor: Takes the 6th notes of the Major scale. A minor is the minor scale of C Major.
-- 1 1/2 1 1 1/2 1 1

- Modes: Take a Major Scale and build a whole bunch of new scales. Each type is defined by intervals:
-- C D E F G A B C -> Ionian (Mode of C) -> 1 1 1/2 1 1 1 1/2
-- D E F G A B C D -> Dorian -> 1 1/2 1 1 1 1/2 1
-- E F G A B C D E -> Phrygian -> 1/2 1 1 1 1/2 1 1
-- F G A B C D E F -> Lydian -> 1 1 1 1/2 1 1 1/2
-- G A B C D E F G -> Mixolydian -> 1 1 1/2 1 1 1/2 1
-- A B C D E F G A -> Aeolian (Minor) -> 1 1/2 1 1 1/2 1 1
-- B C D E F G A B -> Locrian -> 1/2 1 1 1/2 1 1 1

- Niche Scales not made from Major Scale:
-- Acoustic/Lydian Dominant: 1 1 1 1/2 1 1/2 1
-- Byzantine / Double Harmonic: 1/2 1.5 1/2 1 1/2 1.5 1/2

- Chord is a set of notes played together. Name depends on the root node, how many notes are in it, and the interval that separates the notes.
- Triads are chords made of 3 notes. Basis of all chords.
-- Need the Root Node, then a 3rd and a 5th.
-- C Major Chord: C E G. 2 tones between C and E, which is a Major 3rd. 3.5 tones between C and G which is a Perfect 5th.
- Major Chord: Root + Major 3rd + Perfect 5th (Sounds Happy). Major 3rd + minor 3rd
-- C Minor Chord: C E(Flat) G. 1.5 Tones between C and E(flat) is a minor 3rd. 3.5 tones between C and G which is a Perfect 5th.
- Minor Chord: Root + Minor 3rd + Perfect 5th = Minor Chord (Sounds Sad). minor 3rd + Major 3rd
- If you change the order of the notes, the voicing, it will still stay the same chord. E G C is still a C Major Chord.
- If you remove the third in the Chord, it is neither a minor or major. It is a power chord. 
- Can also alter a chord by moving the Perfect 5th. Up 1 semitone (1/2) it becomes Augmented. Down 1 Semitone it becomes diminished.
- Augmented Chord: Root + Major 3rd + Augmented 5th. (Bright Chord) Major 3rd + Major 3rd
- Diminished Chord: Root + Minor 3rd + diminished 5th (Dark Chord) minor 3rd + minor 3rd
- Chords of the C Major Scale: CM, Dm, Em, FM, GM, Am, Bdim. Refer to in roman numerals. I -> VII. These are called degrees. I.e. 1st Degree, 2nd Degree, 3rd Degree, etc. 5th Degree is called the dominant.
- Chords can be created by stacking third on top of each other or taking 1 note every 2 passed.
- Extended Chords Occur when you add more notes on top of the 3. Adding 1 extra gives you the 7th, adding another gives you the 9th, adding another gives you the 11th, adding another gives the 13th chord.

- Intervals
-- Perfect:
--- +1/2 Augmented || -1/2 Diminished
--- Major or Minor have a semitone between the two states. +1/2 Augmented, -1/2 Diminished
-- C Major Scale:
--- 4th and 5th are Perfect
--- 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th are all major.
- Major Chords are built upon the Perfect and Root, Diminished and Minor are built upon the non-perfect intervals

7th Chords
-- Major Triad + minor 7th = Dominant 7th Chord
-- Major Triad + Major 7th = Major 7th Chord
-- minor Triad + minor 7th = minor 7th chord
-- minor Triad + Major 7th = minor Major 7th Chord
-- Diminished Triad + minor 7th = Half-Diminished 7th Chord
-- Diminished Triad + Diminished 7th = Diminished Chord
-- Augmented Triad + minor 7th = Augmented 7th Chord
-- Augmented Triad + Major 7th = Augmented Major 7th Chord
