Consonances and Dissonances:
- The simpler the ratio between the frequencies are the more consonant they are.
- 220Hz. Next ration would be 2:1 at 440, 3:1 at 660hz, 4:1 at 880Hz. This is harmonic series.
- The ratio us how often they will sync up over x period.
- Purity of a Consonance: Absence of beating when two sounds play together.
- Any time you divide or multiply a note by two, you are getting the same not but an octave higher or lower.
- Create a scale:
-- Start with 440hz, or A.
-- Multiple by 3 and then divide by 2: 146,66 | 440 | 1320 -> 293.33 | 440 | 660
-- Same as above: (97.77 | 293.33 | 440 | 660 | 1980) % 2 = (391.11 | 586.66 | 440 | 660 | 495)
-- Final: 391.11 | 440 | 495 | 586.66 | 660 = Pentatonic Scale. G A B D E (G-Major/E-Minor Pentatonic Scale)
-- Adding two more notes gives 521.48 and 742.5. C and F#. G-Major Scale.
-- First note is called the Tonic. Rest are 2nd, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, etc.
-- Next note after is the 8ve. Same note of the tonic
-- Compare to Harmonic Series:
--- 1:1 - Tonic / G
--- 2:1 - 2nd / A
--- 3:1 - 3rd / B
--- 4:1 - 4th / C
--- 5:1 - 5th / D
--- 6:1 - 6th / E
--- 7:1 - 7th / F#
--- 8:1 - 8ve / G
- Within a sound, the lower frequency is called the fundamental.
- All other frequencies are called the overtones.
-- Harmonic Overtones: Participate with the sound. Part of the harmonic series.
-- Inharmonic Overtones: Participate with the tone of the sound. 
- White noise is 100% inharmonic sounds.
- Overtones are the reason a piano and trumpet sound different.
- In a Major scale, the most consonant sounds with the Tonic are the 4th and the 5th, then the third and the sixth, and then the 2nd and the 7th
- The more consonant a sound is, the more overtones they have in common.
- To get the fifth of a note: F(Note) x 3 / 2(or 4)
- The Circle of fifths:
-- C264 x3/2 -> G396 x3/4 -> D297 x3/2 -> A445.5 x3/4 -> E334.125 x3/2 -> B501.188 x3/4 -> F#375.89 -> DFlat281.918 -> AFlat422.877 -> EFlat317.158 -> BFlat475.737 -> F356.803
- How we tune an instrument is called temperament. The way of tuning via the circle of fifths is called the Pythagorean temperament.
- A problem: After F if we try to continue to add another 5th, it should return to the tonic. However, it overshoots it and must be squished causing it to become dissonant (The Wolf Interval)
- Another problem: There was a difference between the third in the temperament and the third in the natural harmonic series.
- To solve this, Meantone Temperaments:
-- The difference in the third(which was 4 consecutive 5ths) is called the comma. Lower each 5th by 1/4 of a comma. Third becomes pure, but sacrifices the fifths.
-- 1/6 or 1/8 instead. Brings it closer to the comma, sacrifices the purity of 1/3rd
- Equal Temperament
-- Every note in the chromatic scale is separated by an equal interval, such as 1/12 octave. All notes are slightly offset, same with intervals, but it makes all fifths and thirds equally consonant.
-- Can now transpose any song in any key without having to retain our instrument.
- Octave is divided into 12 different intervals, so 12 notes.
- Excluding Major and Minor there are 7 notes: CDEFGABC
- Name of Scale Dependent on the Fundamental and How the Note is spaced
- C Major Scale:
-- C Fundamental
-- Major: 1 1 1/2 1 1 1 1/2 tones (Intervals between keys)
- Minor: Takes the 6th notes of the Major scale. A minor is the minor scale of C Major.
-- 1 1/2 1 1 1/2 1 1

- Modes: Take a Major Scale and build a whole bunch of new scales. Each type is defined by intervals:
-- C D E F G A B C -> Ionian (Mode of C) -> 1 1 1/2 1 1 1 1/2
-- D E F G A B C D -> Dorian -> 1 1/2 1 1 1 1/2 1
-- E F G A B C D E -> Phrygian -> 1/2 1 1 1 1/2 1 1
-- F G A B C D E F -> Lydian -> 1 1 1 1/2 1 1 1/2
-- G A B C D E F G -> Mixolydian -> 1 1 1/2 1 1 1/2 1
-- A B C D E F G A -> Aeolian (Minor) -> 1 1/2 1 1 1/2 1 1
-- B C D E F G A B -> Locrian -> 1/2 1 1 1/2 1 1 1

- Niche Scales not made from Major Scale:
-- Acoustic/Lydian Dominant: 1 1 1 1/2 1 1/2 1
-- Byzantine / Double Harmonic: 1/2 1.5 1/2 1 1/2 1.5 1/2

- Chord is a set of notes played together. Name depends on the root node, how many notes are in it, and the interval that separates the notes.
- Triads are chords made of 3 notes. Basis of all chords.
-- Need the Root Node, then a 3rd and a 5th.
-- C Major Chord: C E G. 2 tones between C and E, which is a Major 3rd. 3.5 tones between C and G which is a Perfect 5th.
- Major Chord: Root + Major 3rd + Perfect 5th (Sounds Happy). Major 3rd + minor 3rd
-- C Minor Chord: C E(Flat) G. 1.5 Tones between C and E(flat) is a minor 3rd. 3.5 tones between C and G which is a Perfect 5th.
- Minor Chord: Root + Minor 3rd + Perfect 5th = Minor Chord (Sounds Sad). minor 3rd + Major 3rd
- If you change the order of the notes, the voicing, it will still stay the same chord. E G C is still a C Major Chord.
- If you remove the third in the Chord, it is neither a minor or major. It is a power chord. 
- Can also alter a chord by moving the Perfect 5th. Up 1 semitone (1/2) it becomes Augmented. Down 1 Semitone it becomes diminished.
- Augmented Chord: Root + Major 3rd + Augmented 5th. (Bright Chord) Major 3rd + Major 3rd
- Diminished Chord: Root + Minor 3rd + diminished 5th (Dark Chord) minor 3rd + minor 3rd
- Chords of the C Major Scale: CM, Dm, Em, FM, GM, Am, Bdim. Refer to in roman numerals. I -> VII. These are called degrees. I.e. 1st Degree, 2nd Degree, 3rd Degree, etc. 5th Degree is called the dominant.
- Chords can be created by stacking third on top of each other or taking 1 note every 2 passed.
- Extended Chords Occur when you add more notes on top of the 3. Adding 1 extra gives you the 7th, adding another gives you the 9th, adding another gives you the 11th, adding another gives the 13th chord.

- Intervals
-- Perfect:
--- +1/2 Augmented || -1/2 Diminished
--- Major or Minor have a semitone between the two states. +1/2 Augmented, -1/2 Diminished
-- C Major Scale:
--- 4th and 5th are Perfect
--- 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th are all major.
- Major Chords are built upon the Perfect and Root, Diminished and Minor are built upon the non-perfect intervals
