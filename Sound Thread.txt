How to edit well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLgHqZSe2o0
- Consider what experience the viewers want.
- Use A-roll: See and hear the subject at the same time. Use if for short periods of time when you're saying something important.
- B-Roll: Recorded separately from the audio. Creates a visual depiction of what you are talking about. Use as much as possible.
- B-Roll Alt: Stock Footage and Motion Graphics
- Engagement Spice:
   - Add Movement. Scales, wiggles, zooms, pans, etc
   - Visuals: 
	- Only use Captions when you really want the user to understand what is being said. 3 words or less, is possible.
	- Animate or highlight the most important piece of text.
	- Darken or Blur the area that surrounds the focus point of the image.
	- Shift the hue of the image to adjust meaning. Positive or negative connotation.
	- Circles, Arrows, or underlines also work.
	- Can also make the subject glow.
- Make the video look good. Color grading, subtle vignette, moving particle effects.
- Visual Continuity: The editing should be invisible. Keep focus in same area.
- Immersive Audio: Gather a bunch of sounds. Add sounds where they should be. Whoosh, highlight, etc.
	- Risers are used to build anticipation
	- Hits release tension or emphasize motion. Can be used with/without riser in front.
	- Drones for mystery and intrigue. Darker tones.
	- Music Choice is MASSIVE. Separate video based on subject changes. Cut out music to focus on something. Fade out Music to show section is ending.
		- Sync hits and dips to moments in the video.

GDC Uncommon Techniques: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTE_bVUeHCQ
- Create Friction to build Emotional Resonance.
	- Difficulty, Scarcity, Unconvential Controls, Save System, Time Limit, Durability, Narrative Tension, Bucking Trends, Doesn't have to be negative. A texture.
	- Resonance: When mechanics enhance theme and emotions.
	- Learn to stop worrying and love the one off.
		-Mistake 1: Perfect Gameplay Scripts are Better Scripts. Players won't remember beautiful code, but how the game made them feel.
		-Mistake 2: Structure always improves the creative process. Iteration is messy. No matter how good your tools are, mess is part of the process.
		-Mistake 3: Content patterns always make better content. If your patterns make realizing the experience harder, they are bad patterns.
	- Make everything as simple as possible. But not simpler.
		- K.I.S.S
		- Less is More
		- Everything should be as simple as possible, but no simpler.
		- Learn though mistakes.
		- At some point you simplify too much and it breaks down.
		- Delete everything unnecessary from the process. You may need to add them back later. If you don't add at least 10% back, you didn't delete enough.
		- When is simple not so simple? Aim for a game that is simple to understand, but that is deep and varying over time.
			- Emergent Complexity: Tetris. Add rules over time that build on the other rules. A whole that is more than the sum of it's parts. Games like Go and Chess.
		- Simple Conclusion
			- Find the Fun -> Add improvements -> Simplify until it breaks -> Restore the last subtraction -> Repeat from 2 until you're satisfied (or broke!) -> Bonus! Emergent Complexity for the win!
	- Ruthlessly Prioritizing Your Wildest Imaginations 
		- Here lies PreMortems. Here lies our brilliant idea, killed by: (Brainstorm this with the team)
		- Magic in knowing what to fight for.
