Sound Design and Synth Fundamentals: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJLIS2MkFe4
-----------------------------------
- Basic Shapes:
-- Sin, Triangle, Square, Sawtooth. More harmonics as you go.
- Additive Synthesis: Start with a basic shape, add more shapes to it.
- Subtractive Synthesis: Take away from shape. Using filters, EQ, etc.
- Unison: Adds more waves.
- Detune: As you add Unison, DeTune to make it richer.
- Filter: EQ.
- ADSR: Attack, Delay, Sustain, Release.
- LFOs: It's oscillating at low frequencies. Add movement and operation to the filter, or other parameters.
- FX Processors: Distortion, Flanger, Phaser, etc.

Sound Design for Cinematic Filmmaking | My Process: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I66_LmOTlSk
--------------------------------------------------
- Layers of Audio:
-- Vocals
-- Background Music
-- Sound Design
- SD: Ambience
-- First Layer Added.
-- Should not be overpowering.
- Diegetic Sounds:
-- Sounds that come from the environment.
-- Foley
- Creative Sound Effects:
-- Whooshes, Impacts, Risers, Etc.
-- Whooses are good for transitions, cuts, movements.
-- Risers are great for building anticipation and suspense. Building up to a reveal or smoothing out the environment to a different cut or energy level.
- The Absence of Sound is just as important as the presence of it.
- No need to be literal.
- Artlist
- Panning: Enhances design.
- JCut: Audio from next scene starts playing before the next cut.
- LCut: Audio from previous scene lingers as we move to the next cut.
- Reverb: Creates a sense of space and atmosphere. Push sound into the background.
- EQ: Enhance sounds and voices. Can also make rooms for sounds. High Pass, Low Pass Filter.
- Mixing: Export -> Audio -> Audio Normalization. Listen to film in different speakers.

How I improved My Sound Design: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7DITSVQChM
------------------------------
- Create a Radio Edit: Identify transition points.
- Add Filters to modify sounds
- Blend filtere effects together.
- Customize Speed and Pitch.
- Reverse sound Effect.
- Panner
- Vocal Enhancer + DeReverb + Graphic EQ + Parametric EQ + Hard Limiter

12 Sound Design Tricks I use: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R30L1fIKzpU
----------------------------
- Layering
- Record your own sounds
- Pitch Shifting
- Pitch Automation
- Time Stretching: Use Ableton's Warp Settings
- In Synth, add envelope to various parameters.
- Sample and Hold, get a value and hold on to it.
- Assign your macro knobs.
- Use Effects in Parallel

How to Sound Design a Short Film: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caWge0sQqzw
--------------------------------
- Ring out: Extending the ending of a sound or music track with Reverb to create an Echo-EY Fade out
- Use the same type of Ambience to enhance.
- Can be abstract with Sound Design

ALVA NOTO's SOUND DESIGN PHILOSOPHY you need to know: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XWK5GCznKA
----------------------------------------------------
- Reductionism: Start with a fundamental sound and use it to it's maximum potential.
- Use Granular Synthesis.
- Use Non-Musical Data in a Musical Context.
- Resampling can make sounds usable.

13 Sound Design Tips for More Cinematic Films: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gpSsFEl_T0
----------------------------------------------
- Punctuate impactful moments with powerful hits.
- Ambiance: Use at varying intensities.
- Contrast: Alternate Between loud and quiet sounds.
- Build: Use Risers
- Repetition: If you don't have music, use repetition to give the feeling of a score. Heartbeats, hits, etc.
- Titles: Use Hits to emphasize titles and set the mood.
- DIY: Make your own sound effects. Risers are created through reversing sounds.
- Reverb: Make a Sound Effect feel bigger than it is.
- Layer sound effects.
- Taper or Fade video in and out. Always.
- Feeling: Sometimes an inaccurate sound effect conveys the feeling better.
- Score First: Create the framework of the sound design first. Music, repetition, etc.
- Pitch Shift: Can alter sound effects easily.

A Simple Approach to Sound Design: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D4i-JM3RXw
----------------------------------
- Silence allows you to focus on subtle moments. Creates tension. Etc.
- Use sounds in unexpected ways.
- Use Post-Production Effects.
- Be Selective with your sounds.
- Keep it simple, Keep it intentional.

See With Your Ears: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kavxsXhzD48
-------------------
- Use Sound Design to tell a story. Highlight what you want to focus on.
- Pop certain sounds out of the mix to tell the story.
- Use other sound to interrupt the story and signal a change.
- Subtract sounds from the ambience to further focus the story.
- Silence for tension and lead-in to a large moment.

Sound Design for Filmmaking: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIp6F1wbIIo
---------------------------
- Build Momentum through contrast between soundscapes.
- When you cut between sounds you enhance the feeling when it comes back.
- Loud to soft using risers. Good way to end video.
- A Crash sequence is a great way to start a sequence or transition between. 
- Foley:
-- Does it sound realistic?
-- Is it subtle?
-- No need to be literal.
-- Modify and Manipulate.
- Low Pass Filter can make something sound like it's under water.
- High Pass Filter can make something like a phone call.

Sound Design Tricks that feel like CHEATING!: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGAetp-5N6I
---------------------------------------------
- Use a Mid-cut on Music to create space for Dialogue.
- If song has a good ending, cut it and match it to the a previous beat.
- Cut the track right before the next beat. Copy and move it down, add reverb. Re-introduce beat.
- Cut first beat, last beat, or ending of a song. Reverse it and use it as a riser into the song.
- THINK OF SOUNDS AS FREQUENCY LAYERS THANK YOU FUCKING GOD. Low - Mid - High.

The 9 Fundamentals of Sound Design: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzcx2sm_g4Y
----------------------------------
- Know what you are trying to create.
- The ADSR. Amplitude envelope. As long as the transients match up, you can make anything sound like something else.
- Pitch
- Layering: As long as they are within 35-40 milliseconds of one another, we perceive them coming from the same source.
- Keep it Simple
- Cleaning: Clean up your sounds and keep only what you need.
- Tone: Figure out what kind of tone you want.
- Texture: Add for realism. Can use a noise-oscillator. 
- Size: Figure out how large you want it. Panning, Effects, etc.
- Movement: Automate. Auto-Pan. Etc.
- Depth: Reverb and Delay

3 Sound Design Secrets: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzfzkTAQsnE
-----------------------
- Layer sounds with different frequencies.
-- Apply it outside of sound effects.
- Use sounds that do not match the visuals to create more emotion.
- Layer sound effects to get in and out of songs.
-- Pair it with other techniques.
